NOTE: This project is being abandoned and replaced by https://github.com/compupro/latin-annotator. Not only is it better, but it also doesn't require allowing insecure connections to work.

# latin-autoglosser
A JS web app that automatically glosses Latin text using Perseus XML data. It is in an insanely in-development stage (and also the development is abandoned).

Unfortunately because Tuft's Perseus API doesn't support HTTPS, you have to enable insecure connections on the page for this to work.
