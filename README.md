# latin-autoglosser
A JS web app that automatically glosses Latin text using Perseus XML data. It is in an insanely in-development stage (and also the development is in hiatus).

Unfortunately because Tuft's Perseus API doesn't support HTTPS, you have to enable insecure connections on the page for this to work.
