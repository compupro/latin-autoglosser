# latin-autoglosser
A JS web app that automatically glosses Latin text using Perseus XML data
it's super in development
it doesn't even work across the internet because Perseus doesn't have https

there will be a dictionary lookup feature whenever I find time to do it
and also it's 12:40 in the morning so goodbye
